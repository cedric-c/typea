# typea

TypeA is a file renaming tool used by Type-A personalities to rename PDFs, typically research articles. These research articles often have long names with little meaning. TypeA reads extended file attributes (xattrs) and copies the file to an `out` directory using the format `author_title.pdf`.

## Todo:

1. support for multiple parameters
2. compiled version, placed in bin for easier calls
3. PDF parsing for articles which don't have the needed xattrs.
4. GUI?


If you like this I expect to be referenced in your PhD dissertation! :-)
